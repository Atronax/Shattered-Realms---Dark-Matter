1. Search for galaxy (or galaxies) map - gather data to use for the project

2. Select planetary systems and planets, that will be used in Dark Matter plot
- check smth at Eyes on Exoplanets (NASA)
- several rocky planets (resource centers, mining companies, destroyed civilizations), 
- several superearths (for various kind of surface events), 
- several gas giants (orbital structures and scientific labs), 
- asteroids and asteroid belts (source of life for space pirates, nomads and adventurers, weapon used to destroy planets by EotD and Beast, one of the plot events - use of the dark matter engines to push the planet from the orbit)
- black holes and supermassive black holes (some experiments with anomalies of the dark matter, lead by previous civilizations, that reveal in different ways, used to hide the God civilization, to slow down the time flow etc. One of the plot events - space terrorist, that will sabotage the time control by Dyson sphere orbital lab and move all the civ from slow-downed time to eternal sleep)
- orbital structures, drifting flat worlds, nomad fleets 
- 

3. Separate fractions and there dyplomatic centers: "Angelic Pact" union and "Eye of the Devil" nomad fleet, God of the Mists, renegades, free people and space pirates.
NO secondary planets, just plot specific ones. Some of them are visited just from above (orbital stations and constructions, space ships and other relevant stuff). Other used for surface events (NOTHING usual, every event cannot be tracted as simple evil or good, every event should change the world and influence the further events). Some of these are connected with enslaved creatures, that are used to gather resources of for various experiments with bodies \ DNA \ implants \ dark matter tech etc.

4. Draw map of the whole used world just like for Project Underground. Draw separate maps for planetary systems. Draw surface maps. Or underground maps. Or flying cities maps. Whatsoever.

5. Build main plot rib (one special thing should be told in one per planetary system, they should not repeat or repeat as rare as possible, connections between main events, numbers and arrows to show which part should be next). Fill the world with events and connection between creatures. Use small side stories for that, but try to integrate it into the main plot as tightly as possible.

6. Now, that we have:
	- name of the planetary system
	- description of the planetary system
	- list of plot events (including names of planets and objects)
	- list of used characters
We could separate content into fixed, self-containing parts, that are easy to fill with additional content, descriptions, dialogues, world changes, that are not connected to the party of the main character, and reactions of the world to changes provocated by his group.

7. In this case we would separate the main plot of the story from its sides. Main plot is pretty straight-forward and moves adventurers for one star system to another, from one planet to another in a straight way. Side stories are something different. They are based on tiny, thin nuances of the world lore. Not all the world lore will be used in the book plot, moreover, not all side-stories will be used for the book plot. But. This stuff will go to design doc, for other based-on projects.

In case of Dark Matter the main topics are:
1) Technologies in the world of future and their role in peoples' lives and their interconnections between each other.
2) Space era for civilizations, that are making their first steps to the deep dark of space. And space era for civilizations, that are already tired of space era.
3) Eternal war between science and religion, connections and conflicts based on example of sylphs 
- progressive cities of mountain sylphs vs holy sarg groves of forest sylphs, 
- adventurers that use technologies to present them as gods (like the Zeus, that holds on sub-skin implants to use thunders whatsoever, on one of the planets met by the Beast team on their journey) for knowledge-less tribes on planets in black region or Void,
- ragy nomads that were forced to abandon their faith for creators and turned to deathly dangerous pillagers and agressors).

Every tech, society nuance, places of interest impacts the life of the Universe and could be used as a starting point to make a side story, or speech, or some other way to mention it.
